## About
This program permits the use of Google Play Music with All Access subscription with any music player that is able to stream MP3 files and to manage M3U playlists (e.g., MPD server, VLC, ...). It can work also with a free account without All Access extras.

This project is not supported nor endorsed by Google.

### Features
- create persistent URLs to all the tracks, albums and stations available on the Google Play Music + All Access platform
- get access to all the songs in your collection, playlists and registered stations
- search by name any artist, album or song
- request a transient (it will be not registered in your account) station based on any search (a.k.a. "Instant Mix")
- stream any songs as standard MP3 complete of IDv3 tag with all the information and album image

## Setup

### On Arch Linux
just type:
```
<your AUR helper> -S gmusicproxy
```
and follow the instructions

### Requirements
- a Google Play Music account with All Access subscription (some functionalities continue to work even with a free account)
- a Python 3 interpreter
- some python libs: *gmusicapi*, *netifaces*, *eyed3*, *python-daemon*

### Installation

- The right way to use an under-development python project makes use of `virtualenv` utility:
  - install the proxy once:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv virtualenv
    git clone https://github.com/M0Rf30/gmusicproxy.git
    cd gmusicproxy
    virtualenv .
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    source bin/activate

    ```
  - launch the proxy when you need it:

    ```bash
    ./GMusicProxy
    ```
  - if you need to upgrade the proxy and its dependencies:
    - use the option `--upgrade` on the `pip` installation command (e.g., `pip install --upgrade -r requirements`), or
    - Exit from the virtualenv using `deactivate`.

## Usage

### Command-line
Here a list of the supported options on the command-line:

- `--host`: host in the generated URLs [default: autodetected local ip address]
- `--bind-address`: ip address to bind to [default: 0.0.0.0=all]
- `--port`: default TCP port to use [default: 9999]
- `--oauth`: generate OAuth2 credentials (opens browser)
- `--disable-all-access`: disable All Access functionalities
- `--debug`: enable debug messages
- `--log`: log file
- `--daemon`: daemonize the program
- `--extended-m3u`: enable non-standard extended m3u headers
- `--shoutcast-metadata`: enable Shoutcast metadata protocol support (disabling IDv3 tags)
- `--disable-playcount-increment`: disable the automatic increment of playcounts upon song fetch

Before starting the proxy for the first time, run `GMusicProxy --oauth` to generate OAuth2 credentials. Follow the prompts, and paste the code into your terminal. *This requires All Access.*

### URL-based interface
The only way to use the service is to query the proxy by means of properly formatted HTTP requests over the configured TCP port. Such URLs can be used directly in music programs or in scripts or in any browser. A URL looks like this: `http://host:port/command?param_1=value&param_2=value`. I don't apply any validation to the submitted values: please, be nice with the proxy and don't exploit it! :)

Consider that any song, album, artist, playlist or station got a unique ID in Google Music API but there are many methods to discover them.

Here a list of the supported requests (with some restricted by the availability of a All Access subscription):

- `/get_collection`: reports an M3U playlist with all the songs in your personal collection; the resulting list can be shuffled and/or filtered using the rating; note that not all the rated (liked) songs belong to your collection.
  Allowed parameters:
     - `shuffle`: if the collection has to be shuffled [default: no]
     - `rating`: an integer value (typically between 1-5) to filter out low rated or unrated songs form your collection
- `/get_promoted`: reports an M3U playlist of "promoted tracks"; the resulting list can be shuffled; this is, more or less, your Thumb's Up playlist, kinda.
  Allowed parameters:
     - `shuffle`: if the playlist has to be shuffled [default: no]
- `/search_id`: reports the unique ID as result of a search for an artist, a song or an album.
  Allowed parameters:
     - `type`: search for `artist`, `album` or `song` [required]

### Examples of integration
#### MPD
- You can copy any M3U list generated by the proxy in the playlists registered inside MPD. MPD usually keeps the playlists inside the folder specified by `playlist_directory` in its configuration file `mpd.conf`.

  ```bash
  curl -s 'http://localhost:9999/get_by_search?type=album&artist=Queen&title=Greatest%20Hits' >
    /var/lib/mpd/playlists/queen.m3u
  mpc load queen
  mpc play
  ```

- You can also request a fresh list of songs from a station and add them to the current playlist.

  ```bash
  mpc clear
  curl -s 'http://localhost:9999/get_new_station_by_search?type=artist&artist=Queen&num_tracks=100' |
    grep -v ^# | while read url; do mpc add "$url"; done
  mpc play
  ```

#### VLC
- You can listen any generated playlist using VLC from command-line.

  ```bash
  vlc 'http://localhost:9999/get_by_search?type=album&artist=Rolling%20Stones&title=tattoo&exact=no'
  ```
- You can automatically choose at random one registered station.

  ```bash
  curl -s 'http://localhost:9999/get_all_stations?format=text&only_url=yes' | sort -R | head -n1 | vlc -
  ```
